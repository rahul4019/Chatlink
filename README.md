## 🚀 How to Run ChatLink Locally

Follow these simple steps to set up ChatLink on your local environment.

---

### 🖥️ Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- A working PostgreSQL database (for the backend).

---

### 📝 Steps to Get Started

1. **Clone the Project**  
   Open your terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahul4019/Chatlink.git
   cd chatlink
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Files**

    - Inside the root directory, you will see two folders: api and client.
    - Navigate to the api folder:
        ```bash
        cd api
        ```
    
        Create a .env file by copying the content from .env-example:
        ```bash
        cp .env-example .env
        ```

    - Navigate to the client folder:
        ```bash
        cd ../client
        ```

        Create a .env file here too by copying the content from .env-example:
        ```bash
        cp .env-example .env
        ```

3. **Run the API and Client**

    - First, navigate to the api directory to start the backend server:
        ```bash
        cd api
        npm install
        npm run dev
        ```

    - Open a new terminal window, navigate to the client directory, and start the frontend:
        ```bash
        cd client
        npm install
        npm run dev
        ```

4. **Open the Application**

    - Once both the API and client are running, open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5173
    - You should now see the ChatLink web app! 🎉
